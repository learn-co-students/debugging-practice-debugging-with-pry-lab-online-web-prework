# Debugging

If you clone down this lab and run the tests, you'll notice something:
everything's broken. Like, broken bad. The entire lab is so full of bugs that
even the tests won't run!  And guess what?  It's on you to fix it!

We've narrowed down the two biggest issues and put them into a folder called
'first_priority'.  Once you get the two files in there fixed, you should be able
to run tests and start fixing the rest of the code.

Keep in mind, this lab is about more than just finding and fixing the errors -
it's about understanding how to look for what those errors are.  Don't just
guess and test.

And don't forget to use your best friend `binding.pry` to jump into your code
and confirm your suspicions.
